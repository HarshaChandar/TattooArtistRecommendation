### Tattoo Recommendation and Customer Acquisition Engine 

Tattoo shops normally gain customers by word of mouth, social media, google maps search, or proximity to where someone is living. Customer acquisition is difficult, especially for newer shops or for customers that are new to a city. The apps goal is to match consumers to tattoo shops by inputting an image of a tattoo that they like and specifying whether to focus on content or style. Then matching the customer to a couple shops that have similar styles of tattoos and letting them know the approximate cost.
